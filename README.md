## Description
A Flask blog application is a web application built using the Flask framework, typically designed to allow users to create, edit, and delete blog posts. It can include features such as user registration and login, integration with databases (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB), support for Markdown-based blog content, and the ability to serve and manage blog posts. Additionally, a Flask blog application can be extended to include user authentication, comments, tagging, and internationalization (i18n) features to make the blog accessible and user-friendly for a global audience.
> The application can serve as a platform for users to share content and interact with each other through blog posts.

## Setup
* **Install Dependencies:** Install Flask and any other required dependencies using pip.
* **Create a Virtual Environment:** Set up a virtual environment for the project to manage its dependencies.
* **Set Up the Database:** If using a database, configure the database and integrate it with the Flask application.
* **Integrate Flask-Blogging:** If desired, integrate the Flask-Blogging extension to add Markdown-based blog support to the application.
* **Implement User Authentication:** Set up user authentication to manage user accounts and blog post creation.
* **Develop the Frontend:** Create and serve the frontend files to build the user interface for the blog application.
* **Run the Application:** Once the setup is complete, run the Flask application to launch the blog.
